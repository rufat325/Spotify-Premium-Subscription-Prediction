# Spotify-Premium-Subscription-Prediction
## Project Description
As a newly hired data scientist at Spotify, I developed a machine learning pipeline to assist the marketing department in predicting whether users will switch to paid premium subscriptions. This binary classification task involved analyzing user data such as age, gender, and usage habits to identify patterns in user behavior.

The project involved the following steps:
1. **Data preprocessing**: Handling missing values and balancing class distribution.
2. **Feature engineering**: Creating new features to improve model accuracy.
3. **Model training**: Evaluating several models, including **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, and **XGBoost**.
4. **Evaluation**: The **Random Forest model** performed best with a test accuracy of **74%**.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix
